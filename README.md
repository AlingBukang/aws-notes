AWS Learning Notes

This is a repository of my personal notes on learning AWS, a cloud computing platform that offers a variety of services and solutions for building, deploying, and managing applications. AWS can help you scale your applications, improve your performance, and reduce your costs.

In this repository, you could find:

- A `notes.md` file that contains my notes on various AWS topics, such as EC2, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, and more.
- A `scripts` folder that contains some useful scripts for interacting with AWS using the AWS CLI or SDKs.
- A `templates` folder that contains some CloudFormation templates for creating and managing AWS resources.
- A `README.md` file that explains how to use this repository and provides some useful resources for learning more about AWS.

I hope you find this repository helpful and informative.

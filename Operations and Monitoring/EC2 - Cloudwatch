# Unified Cloudwatch Agent
 - For virtuals servers (EC2 instances, on-premise servers)
 - To collect additional additional system-level metrics such as RAM, processes, used disk space, etc.
 - No logs from EC2 instance will be sent to Cloudwatch without using an agent
 - Centralised configuration via SSM Parameter Store or the agent
 - Needs correct IAM permissions
 - Default namespace for metrics collected by the Unified Agent is called CWAgent; this can be changed

 * procstat Plugin
    - collect metrics and monitor system utilisation of individual processes
    - processes can be monitored by:
        - pid_file - name of process ID(pid)
        - exe - process name filter(RegEx)
        - pattern - command lines used to start the process(RegEx)
    - metrics collected by procstat plugin begins with 'procstat' prefix
    Use Case:
     - Collect memory usage per process
     - Collect CPU time per process


# Metrics for EC2
 - AWS Provided Metrics:
    - Basic monitoring(default); metrics are collected at a 5 minute interval
    - Detailed monitoring(paid); metrics are collected at a 1 minute interval
    - Tracks CPU, Network, Disk and Status Check Metrics
 - Custom Metrics:
    - Basic resolution: 1 minute
    - High resolution: can be as low as 1 second resolution
    - Includes RAM, application level metrics in addition to the AWS provided
    - Needs to configure correct IAM permissions on the EC2 instance role

 EC2 included metrics:
 - CPU - CPU utilisation; credit usage/balance   
 - Network - network in/out
 - Status check:
    - Instance status - check the EC2 VM
    - System status - check the underlying hardware
 - Disk - read/write for ops/bytes (for instance store)
 *Note: RAM is NOT included in AWS EC2 provided metrics, use custom for this




# Status Checks
- System checks
   - monitors the AWS systems on which your instaces run
   Issues:
      - Problems with the underlying host
         - loss of network connectivity
         - loss of system power
         - software issues on the physical host
         - hardware issues on the physical host that impact network reachability
   Resolution options:
         - report to AWS and wait for it to be resolved
         - move the EC2 instance to a new host - stop & start the instance if EBS backed      



- Instance checks
   - monitors the software and network configuration of your individual instance
   Issues:
      - incorrect networking or startup configuration
      - exhausted memory
      - corrupted file system
      - incompatible kernel
   Resolutions options:
      - you tribubleshoot
      - restart the instance
      - modify the EC2 instance configuration
